# MyReads Project
A book tracking app using React

### Installation
1. Clone this project
2. `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. `npm start` or `yarn start`

### Usage
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves", each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

You can select a shelf for a book to move to by clicking on the book and choose the desired shelf.

You can add a book to your library by clicking on the green "plus" icon at the right corner of the page, which will take you to the Search page. Find the book you want by typing in the title of the book in the search bar. Note that search terms are limited to certain keywords, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](./SEARCH_TERMS.md)
